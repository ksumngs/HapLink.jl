Simulate a set of `iterations` reads that contain all of the variant positions in
`haplotype` containing the actual reads present in `bamfile` via a maximum likelihood
method.

`simulate_genome` examines each variant position in `haplotype` and finds a random read
containing that position from `bamfile`. It will then check if the next variant position is
contained on the previous read, and if not pick a new random read that contains that variant
position. In this way, it assembles a set of reads that conceivably could have come from the
same template strand via maximum likelihood.
